            <i>Hello! I'm Frank Jiang â€” a rock climber, badminton player, and aspiring photographer. I'm passionate about outdoor exploration 
                and capturing the beauty of the world through a creative lens. In addition to those things, I also love eating food, trying to cook,
                reading books, and thinking about some life questions. You can check out some of my photos in the stuff below. Let me know if you 
                have any questions, comments or concerns, and thanks again for stopping by my personal website!</i>

                <b>Economics and Strategy:</b>
                <br>
                I focus on understanding how businesses develop competitive advantages and how economic environments influence strategic decision-making.
                Some related topics include but aren't limited to the following: <br>

                Microeconomics: Focuses on individual and firm behavior, resource allocation, and market dynamics.
                Macroeconomics: Explores overall economic performance, growth, and stability.
                Analytical modeling: Develops tools to understand and solve complex economic problems.
                Real-world application: Applies theoretical knowledge to issues like poverty, unemployment, and inflation.

                <b>Psychology:</b><br>
                I'm especially interested in cognitive psychology and decision sciences, particularly how people think, behave, and make choices under uncertainty.
                Here are also some reasons why people study psychology at the school I go to! 
                Reasoning: Studying psychology at WashU is a multi-purpose, valuable discipline, with relevance for those considering careers in law, medicine, the health professions, education, business, and more. As the science concerned with the study of behavior, psychology includes diverse areas of study, including: biological bases of behavior; brain-behavior interactions; learning; memory; cognition; motivation; sensation and perception; the study of social interactions, persuasion, and attitudes; aging and development; personality; clinical, abnormal, and health psychology; and leisure and work experiences.<br><br>
